# VirtualWriting
Virtual Writing is an OpenCV project which enables you to write on screen virtually by making hand movements, with hand holding a pen.
We will calibrate the color of our pen using the file ColorDetector which will enable our model to detect the pen in camera and then we set the values on the TrackBar to variable myColors in the file VirtualPaint.
This way, our model works fine and enables us to write virtually.
